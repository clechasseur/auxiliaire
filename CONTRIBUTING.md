## Contributing to this project

Thank you for considering contributing to this open-source project! Here are a few guidelines to help you:

### I have found a bug or would like to suggest a new feature

Great! You can do so by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/clechasseur/exsb/issues/new/choose).
Before you do, you can also [search existing issues](https://github.com/clechasseur/exsb/issues) to see if your issue was already reported.

### I have found what I think is a security vulnerability in your code

ðŸ˜± If it's a sensitive issue, it is recommended **_NOT_** to create a public issue and instead [report a vulnerability privately](https://github.com/clechasseur/exsb/security/advisories/new).

### I would like to contribute some code to the project

Awesome! If you want to validate whether the contribution is likely to be accepted before starting the work, you can [create an Ideas discussion](https://github.com/clechasseur/exsb/discussions/new?category=ideas) to validate with the maintainers.
When you're ready to start implementing your change, you can [fork this repository](https://github.com/clechasseur/exsb/fork), implement the change and then [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/clechasseur/exsb/compare).
For more information on development in this project, see [DEVELOPMENT](DEVELOPMENT.md).

### I would like to talk to the maintainers regarding something not mentioned above

No problem! If it's OK to do this publicly, you can simply [create a discussion](https://github.com/clechasseur/exsb/discussions/new/choose).
If you'd rather do this privately, you can use the following contact information to send an email:
